Plans for Next Version
======================
* avoid problem with GetTickCount() wrapping to zero after 47 days:
	if (GetTickCount() < mStartTick)
	{
		mStartTick = GetTickCount();
	}

* figure out why the output time values go crazy... after 3300 seconds, it prints 1.84467e+013 for the time on each line until t=4300 seconds, then it starts t back at zero.
