For Version 0.9
===============

* Comments from Erwin Coumans:

"I just used quickprof, and it seems to do the job, after some changes.
- moved stuff into quickprof.cpp, so you can add begin/end profilings in different files (otherwise duplicate linkage).
- nested blocks
- exposing iterators, so you can do your on-screen display easier, line by line.
 
Nice to have
- resetting accumulated percentage after n frames
 
Then I used ';' as delimiter, instead of space, so excel can easier import. This is probably some localization setting, couldn't find it quickly."
